I recently developed a fully functional music player application using Python, Tkinter, and Pygame, which I designed to enhance the user experience of listening to music on desktop. Here are some of the key features:

User-Friendly Interface: The app features a sleek and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter, allowing users to easily navigate their music library and control playback.

Playlist Management: Users can effortlessly add or remove songs from their playlist, with support for multiple MP3 files. The player displays the song titles in a visually appealing list.

Playback Controls: The application includes essential controls such as Play, Pause, Stop, Resume, Next, Previous, and skip forward/backward by 10 seconds, allowing for seamless music playback.

Fullscreen Mode: The app can be run in fullscreen, providing an immersive listening experience with a dark theme that enhances visibility and focus on the music.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to various screen sizes, ensuring that the buttons and song list remain well-positioned and user-friendly.
